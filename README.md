# JKS-Provider-for-Android

In stock Android, JKS is not supported, which led to difficulties in finding a viable solution on the internet. 
The code for JKS.java was not written by me; it was originally created by Casey Marshall in 2003.

This code can be utilized to sign files using JKS keystores or to create custom JKS keystores.
